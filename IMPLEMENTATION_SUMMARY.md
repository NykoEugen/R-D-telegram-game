# Dynamic Scene Graph System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

The dynamic scene graph system has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Core Scene Graph System (`app/game/scenes.py`)
- **SceneGraphManager**: Manages the dynamic scene graph with 24 scenes and 5 end conditions
- **PlayerState**: Tracks player energy, risk level, stats, visited scenes, and cooldowns
- **Scene Types**: 9 different scene types (story, choice, encounter, dialogue, rest, exploration, quest, loot, combat)
- **Transition Logic**: Weighted random selection with requirement checking
- **End Conditions**: Multiple ways to end adventures (risk threshold, energy depletion, step budget, goals)

### 2. Enhanced Action System (`app/game/actions.py`)
- **16 Action Types**: Including new actions like Continue, Rest, Explore, Negotiate, Retreat
- **ActionProcessor**: Handles action consequences with energy costs, risk changes, and stat improvements
- **Scene-Specific Actions**: Different actions available based on scene type
- **Success Probabilities**: Actions can fail with different consequences
- **Stat Modifiers**: Player stats affect action outcomes

### 3. Scene Configuration (`app/game/scenes.yaml`)
- **24 Scenes**: Complete adventure flow from tavern to ancient ruins
- **Dynamic Transitions**: Scenes connect based on requirements and weights
- **Reward System**: Gold, XP, and item rewards for completing scenes
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents scene spam and adds strategic depth
- **Requirement System**: Stat-based and visit-based scene access

### 4. Game Handler (`app/handlers/game.py`)
- **Adventure Command**: `/adventure` starts dynamic adventures
- **Action Processing**: Handles user actions and scene transitions
- **AI Integration**: Uses AI generation service for scene descriptions
- **FSM Integration**: Stores player state in PostgreSQL
- **End Game Logic**: Properly ends adventures with summary

### 5. Configuration Updates (`app/core/config.py`)
- **Scene Settings**: Configurable energy, risk thresholds, and step budgets
- **Environment Variables**: Support for scene seed and other settings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing configuration structure

### 6. Internationalization (`app/locales/`)
- **English & Ukrainian**: Complete translations for all new actions and adventure text
- **Adventure Messages**: Localized adventure start, progress, and end messages
- **Action Descriptions**: Detailed action descriptions for AI generation

### 7. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **PyYAML**: Added for scene configuration parsing
- **All Dependencies**: Verified compatibility with existing system

## ðŸŽ® Core Game Loop Implementation

The system implements the requested core loop:
**City â†’ Adventure â†’ Scene â†’ Choice â†’ (Combat | Event) â†’ Loot â†’ Progress â†’ Return to city**

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Scene Graph**: Scenes are selected based on weights, requirements, and cooldowns
2. **Energy/Stamina System**: Actions cost energy, adventures end when energy is depleted
3. **Risk Management**: Risk level increases with dangerous actions, adventures end at threshold
4. **Stat Progression**: Actions improve character stats (bravery, charisma, intellect, stamina)
5. **Flexible End Conditions**: Adventures can end for multiple reasons, not just step count
6. **AI Integration**: Scene descriptions are generated dynamically using AI
7. **Data-Driven Design**: All scenes and transitions are defined in YAML, no hardcoded logic

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

The test script (`test_scene_graph.py`) confirms:
- âœ… 24 scenes loaded successfully
- âœ… 5 end conditions configured
- âœ… Player state management working
- âœ… Action processing functional
- âœ… Scene transitions operational
- âœ… Requirement checking working
- âœ… Energy and risk systems active

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Starting an Adventure
```
/adventure
```
- Creates player state with 100 energy
- Selects starting scene based on requirements
- Generates scene description with AI
- Presents available actions

### During Adventure
- Player selects actions from available options
- System processes consequences (energy, risk, stats)
- Transitions to next scene based on weights and requirements
- Continues until end condition is met

### Adventure End
- Shows summary of scenes visited, steps taken, rewards earned
- Returns player to city state
- Allows starting new adventure

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Scene Customization
Edit `app/game/scenes.yaml` to:
- Add new scenes
- Modify transition weights
- Change requirements
- Add new end conditions

### Game Balance
Adjust in `app/core/config.py`:
- Default energy levels
- Risk thresholds
- Step budgets
- Energy regeneration rates

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

The system is ready for use and can be extended with:
1. **Dice Expression Parser**: For complex reward calculations
2. **Dynamic Scene Generation**: AI-created scenes
3. **Player Progression**: Level-based unlocks
4. **Save System**: Persistent adventure progress
5. **Achievement System**: Unlock conditions and rewards

## ðŸ“Š Performance

- **Startup**: Scene graph loads once at startup
- **Memory**: Efficient player state caching
- **Transitions**: Fast weighted random selection
- **Scalability**: YAML-based configuration allows easy expansion

The dynamic scene graph system successfully implements a flexible, data-driven adventure system that provides engaging gameplay while maintaining the core loop structure requested.
