# Character Attributes and Progression System

This document describes the comprehensive character attributes and progression system implemented for the Telegram RPG game bot.

## üéØ Overview

The character system implements a complete RPG character progression with:
- **5 Base Attributes** (STR, AGI, INT, VIT, LUK)
- **5 Character Classes** with unique bonuses and progression
- **Derived Stats** calculated from base attributes
- **Leveling System** with XP curves and stat point distribution
- **Interactive Character Creation** and management

## üìä Base Attributes

### Core Attributes
- **STR (Strength)** - Physical damage, carrying capacity
- **AGI (Agility)** - Critical hit chance, dodge chance, accuracy
- **INT (Intelligence)** - Magical damage, spell effectiveness
- **VIT (Vitality)** - Maximum HP, regeneration
- **LUK (Luck)** - Rare loot/events chance

### Starting Values
All characters start with **10** in each attribute, with class bonuses applied during creation.

## üèÜ Derived Stats (Formulas)

All derived stats are calculated automatically from base attributes:

```
HP_MAX = 20 + 4 √ó VIT
ATK = 2 + STR
MAG = 2 + INT
CRIT_CHANCE = min(35%, 5% + 0.5 √ó AGI)
DODGE = min(25%, 2% + 0.4 √ó AGI)
```
